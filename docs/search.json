    "text": "Workshop Overview\nWelcome to the workshop! You can view and follow the introduction slides here.\nI designed this workshop to introduce you to working reproducibly using R/RStudio. It provides a rapid introduction to writing reproducible documents, visualise data, and wrangle data. This book collates all the workshop materials into one place and provides structure for the day. The main resource will be the Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis book which we use to teach MSc conversion students at the University of Glasgow. We designed this book to rapidly cover foundational wrangling, visualisation, and analysis skills, so it’s the perfect resource for a one-day workshop.\nThis book provides the structure to the workshop, so you can easily follow along. Each chapter will outline the key intended learning outcomes and link to the relevant chapter you can follow during the live coding. We will be focusing on reproducible documents, data visualisation, and data wrangling as the most broadly applicable skills. I will then end on a further resources chapter for where you can learn about specific analysis techniques, R resources I like, and people on social media who post about useful R-related stuff.\nAfter the workshop, you can see other resources on my website, github, or feel free to reach out on BlueSky.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "5.1.1 Is the code as reported?\nThe methods and code must match. This means what someone describes in say the method and results section is actually what they apply. For example, if they reported a Pearson correlation but the code is actually for a Spearman correlation, this would be a mismatch between the methods and code. You were all following the same instructions, so you should be able to recognise if your partner applied the instructions accurately, but this will be more useful when it comes to your own papers and projects.\n\n\n5.1.2 Does the code run?\nIf you press run/render, does the code run? This is the simplest check as you do not need to know the intention of the code, just whether it runs or not.\nThis step is achievable for everyone who completes code review. If the folder and file organisation is correct, you should be able to click run all or render, and the code should run in a new session.\nIf it does not run, consider the following:\n\nAre the folders and files where they should be?\nDo you have the necessary packages installed?\nAre there typos in their code?\nIs the code in the wrong order, so it does not run from the start to the finish?\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Is the code reliable\nSimilar to step 1, the idea here is whether the code runs and completes as intended. The worst kind of errors are when code “runs”, but it does not produce the intended output. For example, you select the wrong column, introduce NAs, or use the wrong function. You are all following the same instructions here but it will be more applicable once it comes to working through the whole wrangling to analysis process in your own research.\n\n\n5.1.4 Are the results reproducible?\nThe final step is checking whether the results are reproducible. The idea is to check the output from the code matches what you write in a manuscript. For example, if your code produces a Pearson’s correlation with r = .35, but your manuscript reports r = .53, this would not be reproducible. This will not be possible for today’s tasks as we’re not reporting analyses, but the opportunity to include inline code to insert values from your analyses is one of the best features of R for reproducibility.",

    "text": "5.2 Code review across the workflow\nIvimey-Cook et al. also include suggestions for where in the project workflow code review can be useful.\n\n5.2.1 Project organisation\nIs the folder structure logical? Do you/they use clear folder and sub-folder structure?\nAre the raw data, code, and outputs separated? Do you/they store each component separately?\nDo the file and folder names complement the workflow? Are the names of the files and folder clear enough that you can understand what everything does days, weeks, or months down the line?\n\n\n5.2.2 Project and input metadata\nCan someone understand the workflow and content of the data? If there are multiple scripts or files, is it clear which one you should open first to complete the coding steps in the correct order?\nIs a README provided to explains data contents and curation? This is not something we expect on this course, but a README is a separate file which explains what all the other files and folder do.\n\n\n5.2.3 Code readability\nIs the code understandable? Using clear headings and sub-headings, adding intuitive code comments, use clear object names for what they represent.\nDoes the code have a consistent style? When naming objects, using a clear and consistent naming convention like snake case (clean_data) or camel case (CleanData).\nIs external package use clearly documented? For example, checking they load all the packages in one place and there are not redundant packages which they do not use.\n\n\n5.2.4 Output reproducibility\nCan the results be reproduced? Like step 4 in the 4 Rs, the idea is to check the output from the code matches what you write in the report.\nIs there a clear link between the code and output? As you read through the code, make sure it is clear what each part of the code does. For example, wrangling data and what exclusion criteria mean, and visualising data and what plot settings do.\nKey resource:\n\nhttps://debruine.github.io/talks/code-review/#/title-slide\nCreate a shared OneDrive for people to drop their files into\n\n\n\n\n\nIvimey-Cook, E.

    "text": "3.3 Target Dataset\nFor most of this chapter, we are using open data from Lopez et al. (2023). The abstract of their article is:\n\nImagine a bowl of soup that never emptied, no matter how many spoonfuls you ate—when and how would you know to stop eating? Satiation can play a role in regulating eating behavior, but research suggests visual cues may be just as important. In a seminal study by Wansink et al. (2005), researchers used self-refilling bowls to assess how visual cues of portion size would influence intake. The study found that participants who unknowingly ate from self-refilling bowls ate more soup than did participants eating from normal (not self-refilling) bowls. Despite consuming 73% more soup, however, participants in the self-refilling condition did not believe they had consumed more soup, nor did they perceive themselves as more satiated than did participants eating from normal bowls. Given recent concerns regarding the validity of research from the Wansink lab, we conducted a preregistered direct replication study of Wansink et al. (2005) with a more highly powered sample (N = 464 vs. 54 in the original study). We found that most results replicated, albeit with half the effect size (d = 0.45 instead of 0.84), with participants in the self-refilling bowl condition eating significantly more soup than those in the control condition. Like the original study, participants in the selfrefilling condition did not believe they had consumed any more soup than participants in the control condition. These results suggest that eating can be strongly controlled by visual cues, which can even override satiation.\n\nIn summary, they replicated an (in)famous experiment that won the Ig-Nobel prize. Participants engaged in a intricate setting (seriously, go and look at the diagrams in the article) where they ate soup from bowls on a table. In the control group, participants could eat as much soup as they wanted and could ask for a top-up from the researchers. In the experimental group, the soup bowls automatically topped up through a series of hidden tubes under the table. The idea behind the control group is they get an accurate visual cue by the soup bowl reducing, and the experimental group get an inaccurate visual cue by the soup bowl seemingly never reducing. So, the inaccurate visual cue would interfere with natural signs of getting full and lead to people eating more.\nIn the original article, participants in the experimental group ate more soup than participants in the control group, but the main author was involved in a series of research misconduct cases. Lopez et al. (2023) wanted to see if the result would replicate in an independent study, so they predicted they would find the same results.\nIn the dataset, we have the following variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nParticipantID\nParticipant ID number.\n\n\nSex\nParticipant sex.\n\n\nAge\nParticipant age in years.\n\n\nEthnicity\nParticipant ethnicity.\n\n\nOzEstimate\nEstimated soup consumption in ounces (Oz).\n\n\nCalEstimate\nEstimated soup consumption in calories (kcals).\n\n\nM_postsoup\nActual soup consumption in ounces (Oz).\n\n\nF_CaloriesConsumed\nActual soup consumption in calories (kcals).\n\n\nCondition\nCondition labelled numerically as 0 (Control) and 1 (Experimental).\n\n\n\nWe will use this data to demonstrate how to create different types of plots in ggplot2.",

The abstract of their article is:\n\nThe biggest difference in statistical training from previous decades is the increased use of software. However, little research examines how software impacts learning statistics. Assessing the value of software to statistical learning demands appropriate, valid, and reliable measures. The present study expands the arsenal of tools by reporting on the psychometric properties of the Value of Software to Statistical Learning (VSSL) scale in an undergraduate student sample. We propose a brief measure with strong psychometric support to assess students’ perceived value of software in an educational setting. We provide data from a course using SPSS, given its wide use and popularity in the social sciences. However, the VSSL is adaptable to any statistical software, and we provide instructions for customizing it to suit alternative packages. Recommendations for administering, scoring, and interpreting the VSSL are provided to aid statistics instructors and education researchers understand how software influences students’ statistical learning.\n\nTo summarise, they developed a new scale to measure students’ perceived value of software to learning statistics - Value of Software to Statistical Learning (VSSL). The authors wanted to develop this scale in a way that could be adapted to different software, from SPSS in their article (which some of you may have used in the past), to perhaps R in future. Alongside data from their new scale, they collected data from other scales measuring a similar kind of construct (e.g., Students’ Attitudes toward Statistics and Technology) and related constructs (e.g., Quantitative Attitudes).\nThe data from Alter et al. is split into two data files. In Alter_2024_demographics.csv, we have the participant ID (StudentIDE) and several demographic variables.
