## Preparation steps

-   R and RStudio downloaded to your laptop? ✔️

\newline

-   Workshop and Quant Fundamentals books open? ✔️

\newline

-   Workshop files downloaded? ✔️

## Intended learning outcomes

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to: 

1. Write reproducible reports using R Markdown / Quarto.

2. Clean and wrangle data into appropriate forms for visualisation and analysis.

3. Use the `ggplot2` package for creating a range of plots.

4. Share/receive code to conduct a brief code review.

## Why R? 

**Perfect for researchers**

- Well-integrated tool popular in psychology researchers.

- Ecosystem of well-maintained packages (e.g., *tidyverse*).

**Perfect for educators**

- Reinforce *reproducible teaching* ([Dogucu & Çetinkaya-Rundel, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2022.2138645)) through using Quarto to create teaching materials.
