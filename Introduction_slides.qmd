## Preparation steps

-   R and RStudio downloaded to your laptop? ✔️

\newline

-   Workshop and Quant Fundamentals books open? ✔️

\newline

-   Workshop files downloaded? ✔️

## Intended learning outcomes

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:

1.  Write reproducible reports using R Markdown / Quarto.

2.  Clean and wrangle data into appropriate forms for visualisation and analysis.

3.  Use the `ggplot2` package for creating a range of plots.

4.  Share/receive code to conduct a brief code review.

## Why R?

**Perfect for researchers**

::: incremental
-   Well-integrated tool popular in psychology researchers.

-   Ecosystem of well-maintained packages (e.g., *tidyverse*).

-   Develop a complete reproducible pipeline from raw data to your analysis.
:::

**Perfect for educators**

::: incremental
-   Reinforce *reproducible teaching* ([Dogucu & Çetinkaya-Rundel, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/26939169.2022.2138645)) through using Quarto to create teaching materials.

## R workflow

## Key messages

::: columns
::: {.column .incremental width="50%"}
-   No one is going to be an expert R user after today; you will learn by doing.

-   There is nothing wrong with copying and adapting code; you need to know enough to know how to find solutions.

-   Your code does not need to be pretty, just annotated and reliable.

## Introduction to R/RStudio

**Intended learning outcomes**:

By the end of this part, you will be able to:

-   Navigate and interact with RStudio.

-   Use an R function and find help documentation.

-   Install and load R packages.

-   Assign content to an object.

## Writing reproducible documents

**Intended learning outcomes**:

By the end of this part, you will be able to:

-   Understand and set your working directory, either manually or through creating an R project.

-   Create and render a Quarto file to create a reproducible document.

-   Use inline code to combine text and code output in your reproducible documents.

-   Identify and fix common errors in rendering Quarto files.

## Data visualisation {.smaller}

**Target dataset**: Lopez et al. (2023) on visual cues and food intake.

**Intended learning outcomes**:

By the end of this part, you will be able to:

-   Understand the `ggplot2` layering system of creating plots.

-   Create and edit histograms to visualise the frequency of observations collated into bins.

-   Create and edit barplots to visualise the frequency of different categories.

-   Create and edit a scatterplot to visualise the relationship between two continuous variables.

-   Create and edit a violin-boxplot to visualise the density of data points in a continuous outcome.

-   Save plots as an image to use in reports or presentations.

## Data wrangling {.smaller}

**Target dataset**: Alter et al. (2024) on assessing the perceived value of statistics software.

**Intended learning outcomes**:

By the end of this part, you will be able to:

-   Join two data sets by matching one or more identifying columns in common.

-   Select a range and reorder variables in your data set.

-   Modify or create variables, such as recoding values or creating new groups.

-   Filter observations to retain a subset of your data.

-   Summarise your data to calculate summary statistics.

-   Restructure data into different formats, such as long and wide form.

-   String together multiple functions using pipes.

## Code review

Inspired by Ivimey-Cook et al. (2023), we will explore the four Rs: 

::: {.incremental}

1. Is the code as reported? 

2. Does the code run? 

3. Is the code reliable? 

4. Are the results reproducible? 

:::

## Independent task and code review

**Target dataset**: Farias et al. (2019) on motivations to go on a pilgrimage.

**Intended learning outcomes**:

By the end of this part, you will be able to:

-   Apply your wrangling and visualisation skills to a new dataset.

-   Understand the basic principles of code review for quality control.

-   Conduct a code review of your partner's code.
